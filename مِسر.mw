Egypt



The capital city, Cairo, is Africa's largest city and has been renowned for centuries as a center of learning, culture and commerce.

Egypt also hosts two major religious institutions. [[Al-Azhar University]], the oldest Islamic institution for higher studies (founded around [[970]] CE) with its corresponding mosque Al-Azhar. The head of Al-Azhar is traditionally regarded as the supreme leader of Sunni Muslims all over the world. Egypt also has a strong Christian heritage as evidenced by the existence of the [[Coptic Christianity|Coptic Orthodox Church]] headed by the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], which claims a following of 50 million Christians worldwide (one of the famous Coptic Orthodox Churches is Saint Takla Haimanot Church in Alexandria http://www.St-Takla.org ). 

Though considered a low-income country, Egypt has a thriving media and arts industry, with more than 30 satellite channels and more than 100 motion pictures produced a year. To bolster its media industry, especially with the keen competition from the [[Persian Gulf states]] and Lebanon, it has built a large media city that it has promoted as the "Hollywood of the East". Egypt has the only Opera House amongst Arab countries. 

Some famous Egyptians include: 
[[Naguib Mahfouz]] (Nobel Prize-winning novelist), 
[[Umm Kulthum]] (singer),
[[Omar Sharif]] (actor), 
[[Ahmed H. Zewail|Ahmed Zewail]] (Nobel Prize-winning chemist),

[[Mohamed ElBaradei]] (Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency), and 
[[Anwar Sadat]] (former president and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.)

{{Biological classification}}
In [[biological classification]], '''taxonomic rank''' is the relative level of a group of organisms (a [[taxon]]) in a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[hierarchy]]. Examples of taxonomic ranks are [[species]], [[genus]], [[family (biology)|family]], [[order (biology)|order]], [[class (biology)|class]], [[phylum (biology)|phylum]], [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[domain (biology)|domain]], etc.

A given rank subsumes under it less general categories, that is, more specific descriptions of life forms. Above it, each rank is classified within more general categories of organisms and groups of organisms related to each other through inheritance of [[phenotypic trait|traits]] or features from common ancestors. The rank of any ''species'' and the description of its ''genus'' is ''basic''; which means that to identify a particular organism, it is usually not necessary to specify ranks other than these first two.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art2 |at=Articles 2 and 3 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants – Melbourne Code |year=2012 |website=IAPT-Taxon.org}}</ref>

Consider a particular species, the [[red fox]], ''Vulpes vulpes'': the next rank above, the genus ''[[Vulpes]]'', comprises all the "true" foxes. Their closest relatives are in the immediately higher rank, the family [[Canidae]], which includes dogs, wolves, jackals, and all foxes; the next higher rank, the order [[Carnivora]], includes [[Caniformia|caniforms]] (bears, seals, weasels, skunks, raccoons and all those mentioned above), and [[Feliformia|feliforms]] (cats, civets, hyenas, mongooses). Carnivorans are one group of the hairy, warm-blooded, nursing members of the class [[Mammalia]], which are classified among animals with backbones in the phylum [[Chordata]], and with them among all animals in the kingdom [[Animalia]]. Finally, at the highest rank all of these are grouped together with all other organisms possessing [[cell nuclei]] in the domain [[Eukarya]].

The ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' defines ''rank'' as: "The level, for nomenclatural purposes, of a [[taxon]] in a taxonomic hierarchy (e.g. all families are for nomenclatural purposes at the same rank, which lies between superfamily and subfamily)."<ref>{{citation |author=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=1999 |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.
